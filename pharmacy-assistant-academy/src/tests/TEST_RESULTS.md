# Integration Test Results

## Test Execution Date
2025-10-19

## Overview
Integration tests have been created and executed for the 藥助Next學院 (Pharmacy Assistant Academy) platform. The tests cover API endpoints, authentication flows, and file operations.

## Test Coverage

### 1. API Integration Tests (`api-integration.test.ts`)
Tests all major API endpoints including:
- Health check endpoints ✅
- Authentication endpoints ✅ (partial)
- Course management endpoints ⚠️
- Job listing endpoints ⚠️
- Instructor management endpoints ⚠️
- Document management endpoints ⚠️
- Error handling ✅

### 2. Authentication Flow Tests (`auth-flow.test.ts`)
Tests complete user authentication workflows:
- Job seeker registration and login ✅
- Employer registration and login ✅
- Token validation and security ✅
- Password security ✅
- Profile access with authentication ⚠️

### 3. File Operations Tests (`file-operations.test.ts`)
Tests file upload and download functionality:
- Document listing ⚠️
- Document upload with authentication ⚠️
- Document retrieval ⚠️
- File type validation ⚠️

## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests:** 47
**Passed:** 24 (51%)
**Failed:** 23 (49%)

## Issues Identified

### 1. API Response Structure Issues
- **Issue:** Profile endpoint returns `{ user: {...} }` instead of user data directly
- **Affected Tests:** 
  - `should get user profile with valid token`
  - `should access protected profile endpoint with token`
- **Recommendation:** Update API to return user data directly or update tests to match actual structure

### 2. Missing API Routes
The following routes are not implemented:
- `GET /api/v1/documents` - Document listing
- `POST /api/v1/documents` - Document upload
- `PUT /api/v1/users/profile` - Profile update
- `GET /api/v1/jobs?location=台北` - Query parameter handling for jobs

### 3. Database Issues
- **Issue:** Missing database tables
  - `instructors` table does not exist
  - `jobs` table may have issues with `getDb()` function
- **Recommendation:** Run database migrations before testing

### 4. Course API Response Format
- **Issue:** Course list endpoint returns empty array instead of `{ courses: [] }`
- **Recommendation:** Standardize API response format

### 5. Query Parameter Handling
- **Issue:** Router doesn't properly handle query parameters in URLs
- **Example:** `/api/v1/jobs?location=台北` returns 404
- **Recommendation:** Update router to strip query parameters before matching routes

## Successful Test Areas

### ✅ Core Authentication
- User registration (both job seekers and employers)
- User login with credentials
- Duplicate email prevention
- Password validation
- Token-based authentication
- Invalid token rejection
- Password security (no password in responses)

### ✅ Health Checks
- API health endpoint
- API info endpoint

### ✅ Error Handling
- Invalid JSON handling
- Missing required fields validation
- Weak password rejection

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

2. **Fix API Response Structures**
   - Standardize response format across all endpoints
   - Ensure consistency between documentation and implementation

3. **Implement Missing Routes**
   - Document management endpoints
   - Profile update endpoint
   - Query parameter support in router

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Router Enhancement**
   - Update path matching to handle query parameters
   - Improve error messages for debugging

2. **API Standardization**
   - Create consistent response wrapper
   - Document API response formats

3. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure all migrations are run
   - Add database seeding for test data

## Test Execution Instructions

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npm run test -- src/tests/api-integration.test.ts
```

### Run Tests in Watch Mode
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Generate Coverage Report
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Integration test framework set up
2. ✅ Core authentication tests passing
3. ⏳ Fix identified API issues
4. ⏳ Run database migrations
5. ⏳ Implement missing endpoints
6. ⏳ Re-run tests to verify fixes
7. ⏳ Achieve 80%+ test pass rate

## Notes

- Tests are designed to work with real database connections
- Some tests may fail if database is not properly initialized
- Tests create test users with timestamps to avoid conflicts
- Authentication tokens are properly tested for security
- Error handling is comprehensive and working correctly

## Conclusion

The integration test suite successfully identifies several integration issues between the frontend and backend systems. The core authentication system is working well, but several API endpoints need attention. Once the identified issues are resolved, the system will have comprehensive integration test coverage.
